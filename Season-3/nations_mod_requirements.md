## Joining nations GUI
- Basic info about each nation
- If the nation has requirements for joining, clicking join links to their Discord, otherwise it just puts them in the country
- Links to each country's page on the website, international laws, and other SMP stuff
- Also a button to leave your current nation
- Can be pulled up with a command
- Players not in a nation get a message every time they join telling them how to use the command


## /info (nation) command
- tells a bit about the country and gives a link
- gives both the total population and the population of active citizens
- tells the current country leader


## Population control commands
- there should be commands to kick a player from a country or block them from joining
- these commands should be usable by the nation leader
- potentially the nation leader could grant/revoke other players' access to these commands


## Active citizens criteria
- Determined by how often you log on and for how long
- Also when your most recent log on was
- To be an active player you have to join at least twice every two weeks for intervals of at least an hour
