## Settlements and Nations:
- 1-2 players is a base, 3-5 is a town, 6+ is a city
- amount of players to be considered a city changes depending on player count
- Cities may become nations if they have a fully formed constitution, laws, and a flag
- Nations may choose a citizen (delegate) to represent them in the Council.
- Maximum amount of nations is decided by (# active players) / (min city pop)
- If the nation cap is reached and another city wishes to become a nation, the council can choose which of their members that does not meet the nation requirements must leave
- Nations that no longer meet the requirements, or have been found in serious violation of international law by the court, may be voted off of the council
- Nations that are not represented in the council revert to cities
- Order of the Gilded Star (WR) and Magical Democracy start out as the two options


## Waffles SMP Council:
- A body of delegates chosen by each country
- Propose public votes for international laws, how the server should be run, and other decisions
- Public votes last for three days before closing
- Run the international court, may serve as a jury or choose a judge instead
- Organize events on the server


## Player Role in Government:
- Any player can be appointed delegate by their nation, but those with criminal records may be rejected by the Council
- All players on the server can vote on Council propositions
- If a delegate becomes inactive, they may be kicked out by the Council
- If a countryâ€™s delegate is kicked out of the Council or banned, they have one week to choose a new delegate before reverting to a City


## Wafcorp Role in Government:
- Consists of the Board and the Modstaff
- Wafcorp has a seat on the Council and can propose votes if necessary
- Wafcorp may overturn any vote or Council decision as a last resort - our goal is to NEVER use this ability, we have not used it so far in the past two seasons
